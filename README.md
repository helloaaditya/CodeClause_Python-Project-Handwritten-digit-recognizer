Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is a simple handwritten digit recognition program using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras and trained on the MNIST dataset. The program allows the user to draw a digit on a canvas using their mouse, and the CNN will predict what digit was drawn.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Keras
    Tensorflow
    Pillow
    tkinter

Installation

    Clone the repository
    Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Run python handwriting_recognition.py in your terminal or command prompt.
    A GUI window will open with a canvas for drawing and a "Recognize" button.
    Draw a digit on the canvas using your mouse.
    Click the "Recognize" button to see the predicted digit and its confidence level.
